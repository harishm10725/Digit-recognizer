## Project Overview
The Digit Recognizer project aims to develop a machine learning application that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits from images. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project addresses the challenge of digit recognition, which is crucial in various applications such as automated form processing, check reading, and postal address recognition.

### Key Objectives:
Accurate Digit Classification: Implement a CNN model to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits from 0 to 9.
Image Preprocessing: Utilize techniques to preprocess input images for better model performance, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
User Interaction: Create a simple user interface that allows users to upload images of handwritten digits and receive instant predictions.
Target Audience:
This project is aimed at developers, researchers, and students interested in machine learning and computer vision. It serves as an educational tool for understanding digit recognition using CNNs and provides a hands-on experience with TensorFlow and Keras.

### Expected Outcomes:
A fully functional model capable of recognizing handwritten digits with a significant degree of accuracy.
Documentation and guidelines for replicating the model, enhancing understanding, and promoting further research in digit recognition.
